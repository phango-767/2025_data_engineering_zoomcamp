# Why Terraform?

- Simplicity in keeping track of infrastructure
- Easier collaboration
- Reproducibility
- Ensure resources are removed

# What Terraform is NOT

- Does not manage and update code on infrastructure
- Does not give you the ability to change immutable resources
- Not used to manage resources not defined in your terraform files

# What is Terraform?
- *Infrastructure as code*


## Key Terraform commands
