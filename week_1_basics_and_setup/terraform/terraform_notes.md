    "## Terraform Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is Terraform?\n",
    "    - open-source tool by HashiCorp, used for provisioning infrastructure resources\n",
    "    - supports DevOps best practices for change management\n",
    "    - Managing configuration files in source control to maintain an ideal provisioning state for testing and production environments\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is IaC?\n",
    "     - Infrastructure-as-Code\n",
    "     - build, change, and manage your infrastructure in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way by defining resource configurations that you can version, reuse, and share.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Some advantages\n",
    "    - Infrastructure lifecycle management\n",
    "    - Version control commits\n",
    "    - Very useful for stack-based deployments, and with cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, Azure, K8Sâ€¦\n",
    "    - State-based approach to track resource changes throughout deployments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Files\n",
    "- `main.tf`\n",
    "- `variables.tf`\n",
    "- Optional: `resources.tf` , `output.tf`\n",
    "- `tfstate`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Declarations\n",
    "- `terraform`: configure basic Terraform settings to provision your infrastructure \n",
    "    - `required_version`: minimum Terraform version to apply to your configuration\n",
    "    - `backend`: stores Terraform's \"state\" snapshots, to map real-world resources to your configuration. \n",
    "        - `local`: stores state file locally as `terraform.tfstate`\n",
    "    - `required_providers`: specifies the providers required by the current module\n",
    "- `provider`:\n",
    "    - adds a set of resource types and/or data sources that Terraform can manage\n",
    "    - The Terraform Registry is the main directory of publicly available providers from most major infrastructure platforms.\n",
    "- `resource`\n",
    "    - blocks to define components of your infrastructure\n",
    "    - Project modules/resources: google_storage_bucket, google_bigquery_dataset, google_bigquery_table\n",
    "- `variable` & `locals`\n",
    "    - runtime arguments  and constants\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `terraform init`:\n",
    "    Initializes & configures the backend, installs plugins/providers, & checks out an existing configuration from a version control.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `terraform plan`:\n",
    "    Matches/previews local changes against a remote state, and proposes an Execution Plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `terraform apply`:\n",
    "    Asks for approval to the proposed plan, and applies changes to cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `terraform destroy`:\n",
    "    Removes your stack from the Cloud"
